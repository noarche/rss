# üì∞ RSS READER 

Simple yet powerful RSS reader, Complete with a dark theme!

After the first run look for a file named `index.html` and open it. This is the 'table of contents'.

Imagine having a beautiful, custom webpage that keeps you updated with the latest news and stories from your favorite websites. With our tool, you can choose between a sleek, modern dark theme or a clean, light theme to match your style.

Every hour, your page refreshes itself with the newest content, making sure you're always in the know. The best part? It does all this quietly in the background, using minimal data and resources, so you don't have to worry about slowing down your browsing or eating up your bandwidth.

Whether you're working late at night and need a dark, easy-on-the-eyes view, or you prefer a bright, crisp look during the day, this tool gives you the freedom to choose. It‚Äôs like having your personal news hub, beautifully designed just the way you like it, and always up-to-date.
